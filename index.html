	         <p>❤️🧡💛💚💙💜
	         <h2>❓ What is this?</h2>
	         <p>For the 4th anniversary of Sketchers United, we are going to (attempt to) line up submitted artwork from Sketchers United members such that it resembles a gigantic Sketchers United logo.
	         <br>The shape won't seem very evident at the beginning, however as more submissions are made the more we can approximate the shape.
	         <br>You can use the view here to look at the submitted artworks and view the construction of the collaborative Sketchers United logo.
	         <br>
	         <br>We aim to update the view every few days with the newest submissions.</p>

             <h2>🌐 How do I use this page?</h2>
             <p>Use either the mouse wheel or your fingers to zoom in and out of the view.
             <br> You can tap on the image to see who drew it and get a link to the post.
             <br>
             <br>ℹ️ The view may get somewhat laggy on a mobile device. For the best experience use a desktop computer.
             <br>This is unavoidable due to the number of images downloaded and shown.
             <br>It may also fail to load images correctly on Chrome on newer versions of Android, leading to the page freezing. In this case, use the Firefox browser or a desktop computer.

	         <h2>☝️ How do I join?</h2>
	         <p><b>📩 Submit an entry under the hashtag <a href = "https://sketchersunited.org/tags/sucollab" class = "rainbow">#sucollab</a> to enter.</b>
	         <br>Entries can contain any subject matter however inappropriate entries will be discarded.

	         <p><b> You can submit a single entry on your own.</b>
	         <br>You are allowed to submit more than one entry if you are working with friends to submit a collaborative entry.
	         <br>For example, you can submit an entry with only your own artwork, and then submit another entry which contains your work and the work of others that was created collaboratively.

	         <p><b>⚠️ Make sure that it is square and at least 1000 pixels wide and high.</b>
	         <br>We will be using all of the entries where possible, which means if your entry does not fit these requirements it will be cropped and upscaled, which may be destructive to your art.</p>
